\# Simple Snake Game in C++



Hi! This is my small C++ Snake game project.  

I made it while learning C++, so the code is simple and not very advanced,  

but it works and I’m proud of it :)



This version is made to run in an online compiler,  

so it doesn’t use Windows-only libraries like `conio.h` or `windows.h`.



\## 🎮 How the game works

\- The snake moves inside a small field.

\- You control it using:

&nbsp; - \*\*w\*\* = up  

&nbsp; - \*\*s\*\* = down  

&nbsp; - \*\*a\*\* = left  

&nbsp; - \*\*d\*\* = right  

\- After each move you press \*\*ENTER\*\* (because online compilers don’t support real-time input).

\- If you eat the fruit, your score goes up and the tail grows.

\- If you hit a wall or your own tail — game over.



\## ▶ How to run it

You can run it in any online C++ compiler, for example:



\- OnlineGDB  

\- Programiz  

\- Replit  



Just copy the code from `snake.cpp` and press \*\*Run\*\*.



\## 🧠 Why I made this

I wanted to practice:

\- basic game loops  

\- drawing a field in the console  

\- simple logic (movement, collisions, score)  

\- working without Windows-specific libraries  



Also I wanted to have a small “real” project in my GitHub.



\## 📌 Notes

This is a beginner-friendly version.  

It’s not super fast or fancy, but it’s easy to understand and modify.  

I might improve it later with:

\- real-time controls  

\- colors  

\- levels  

\- speed increase  



For now, this is my first working Snake game in C++ :)



Thanks for checking out my project!
